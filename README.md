Educational game for Sugar

This game is designed to teach younger children the connection between clocks and time as well as how to read an analog clock.  

The game currently has three different language settings: English, Spanish, and French.

There are three different menu settings: Play, Challenge, and Tutorial.

Play: This game mode has the player interact with the clock hands to match their displayed time with the goal time displayed.
If the play does this correctly, a sun is displayed and the player is awarded one sun.  We plan on implementing a reward system
to give meaning to the suns you are awarded.  These suns will turn into a currency where players can purchase new themes for the game
and customize almost everything!

Challenge: This game mode is has the same exact concept of the 'Play' game mode, execpt here your time is not displayed, only the
goal time.  This creates more of a challenge for children to tell time only by reading the clock rather than comparing their displayed
time and the goal time and adjusting the hands until the two are identical.

Tutorial: This screen just shows the layout of the XO laptop keyboard and what buttons the player will need to use to play the game.
